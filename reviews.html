                    I’ve lived in the oconomowoc area for over 10 years. In
                    said time, I have visited many of the local restaurants.
                    Amalia's Family Restaurant is absolutely my favorite for
                    several reasons. When I enter the restaurant I am always
                    greeted by a smiling face and welcoming attitude. When you
                    come to Amalia's there are 2 things you can always expect.
                    More food than you should eat and extremely fast service.
                    Amalia's cooks are faster than any fast food restaurant in
                    the county! You can't even finish a conversation before your
                    food is brought to you. I would absolutely recommend all of
                    my friends and family to Amalia's.

                    The first time I went to Amalia’s was 9 years ago.  
                    I was having breakfast with a friend, who is now my husband.  
                    We hung around for hours which was very nice of the owners to let us do. 
                    So ever since then, my family and I have been avid visitors at their restaurant.  
                    The minute you walk in, you feel welcomed. The staff is friendly.  
                    They are always working together to have the floor run smoothly. 
                    Once you order, you get your food within 5-10 mins. 
                    Sometimes it seems faster than fast food places. On top of that, it tastes amazing! 
                    If you are looking for a family friendly restaurant with amazing food, this is the place. 
                    I know my family and I will never stop coming to Amalia’s as long as they are open.

                    It's a tradition for my fiance and I to go to Amalia's every Tuesday when we have the chance.
                    The staff there are absolutely amazing. 
                    Amalia and Sam are so kind and we love messing around with them. 
                    Manuel is absolutely amazing. We love joking with him and his cooking is AMAZING!
