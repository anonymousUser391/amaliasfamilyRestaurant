                  Amalia's Family Restaurant is absolutely my favorite for
                  several reasons. When I enter the restaurant I am always
                  greeted by a smiling face and welcoming attitude. When you
                  come to Amalia's there are 2 things you can always expect.
                  More food than you should eat and extremely fast service.
                  Amalia's cooks are faster than any fast food restaurant in
                  the county! You can't even finish a conversation before your
                  food is brought to you. I would absolutely recommend all of
                  my friends and family to Amalia's.

                  We hung around for hours which was very nice of the owners to let us do.
                  So ever since then, my family and I have been avid visitors at their restaurant.
                  The minute you walk in, you feel welcomed. The staff is friendly.
                  They are always working together to have the floor run smoothly.
                  Once you order, you get your food within 5-10 mins.
                  Sometimes it seems faster than fast food places. On top of that, it tastes amazing!
                  If you are looking for a family friendly restaurant with amazing food, this is the place.
                  I know my family and I will never stop coming to Amalia’s as long as they are open.

                  The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming, with a wide menu selection that offers something for

                  quantity or portion size. Throw in lighting fast service and it's easy to understand why they have

                  I have been going to Amalia's for about 10 years or so.
                  I have always been happy with the food both in taste and quantity.
                  They do have a very family atmosphere that is present when I am there.
                  It is a great place to take your family and friends.
                  Everyone there knows me by sight and name just adding to the family feeling.
                  I am a big man with a big appetite, they know how to satisfy my appetite.
                  My favorite breakfast is a double or triple order of banana oatmeal pancakes.
                  My favorite dinner is a double order of the chimichanga's with chicken and beef.

                  Amalias has been the go-to breakfast restaurant for some years now.
                  The breakfasts are to die for as well as the wide variety they offer.
                  Whether you're grabbing a cinnamon roll before work or sitting down to
                  dinner with a group of friends it’s always a good time and it’s always delicious.

                  Amalia's is truly a family restaurant.
                  Named after the owners' daughter, the restaurant has a varied menu and also serves beer, wine, and
                  mixed drinks.
                  The portions are generous and my wife and I often split entrees.
                  Unlike some restaurants, there is not a plate charge for sharing meals.
                  The staff is friendly and attentive. They also have a counter where regular customers meet and
                  socialize.
                  Dad, who also is an excellent baker, runs the kitchen and Mom runs the dining room.
                  Service is fast and the food is excellent.
